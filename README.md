# CoinbaseBoard

### Description:

- The goal of this project is to create a simple architecture that takes information from coinbase services to track and display values pertaining to the coins that users own.
  - The main issue with coinbase's app is that all coin information / charts are relative to the coin price not the amount of coins you own. 
- So the main feature will be a ticker style graph that can be displayed on a TV from something like a raspberry pie in order to show you in realtime (5 minute intervals) how your specific wallets are doing.
